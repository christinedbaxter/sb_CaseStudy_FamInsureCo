## Part II: Inferential Statistics

### Topics Covered

1. **Dual Axes Plotting**: How to plot multiple variables on different axes.
2. **Correlation and Heatmaps**: Interpreting correlation coefficients and understanding heatmaps.
3. **Categorical Conversion**: Converting categorical columns into numerical outputs for modeling.
4. **Linear Regression Modeling**: Creating and assessing the goodness of fit for linear regression models using the statsmodels.api library.

### Predictive Modeling

1. **Multiple Regression Model**: Employed the statsmodels.api library to perform Ordinary Least Squares Regression.
2. **Coefficient Analysis**: Analyzed the coefficients to interpret the model.
3. **Model Validation**: Validated the predictions to assess model performance.
